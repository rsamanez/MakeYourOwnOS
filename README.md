# Make your own x86 OS from scratch
This project is being carried out following the guide written by Erik Helin and Adam Renberg in his book called "The little book about OS development".   
The x86 architecture is, and has been for a long time, one of the most common hardware architectures. It was not a difficult choice to use the x86 architecture as the target of the OS.   
It is a requirement to be comfortable with UNIX/Linux systems programming, the C language and computer systems in general such as hexadecimal notation.

   
## Step One
set up our development environment and boot up our OS kernel in a virtual machine, eventually starting to write code in C.

## Step Two
Writing to the screen and the serial port

## Step Three
Dive into segmentation

## Step Four
Interrupts and inputs

## Step five
Quite functional but bare-bones OS kernel

## Step Six
start the road to user mode applications, with vistual memory through paging, memory allocation, and finally running a user application

## Step Seven
Advance topics of file systems, system calls, and multitasking.
